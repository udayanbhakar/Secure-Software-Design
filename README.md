First Problem
PCP 1
PACECAR 1:

OK so write, compile, and execute a C program that does the following:

Create a character array to hold your flag

Loop through this array of values: [110, 1, 105, 110, 1, 106, 2, 97, 123, 100, 3, 117, 53, 5, 116, 95, 48, 102, 8, 102, 95, 121, 48, 117, 114, 95, 67, 125]

If a value is <= 10 skip it Otherwise append the letter whose ascii value matches the given value to your flag

Print the flag

Send me the source code
